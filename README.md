# RustyTracer
This project's purpose is strictly for learning Rust-lang and learning more about ray tracing. This project is still in a very early stage. Do not expect much from it currently. I plan to eventually implement a form of path tracing for more realistic caustics and other such things. Currently, the method of shadowing is a 'hack'.
